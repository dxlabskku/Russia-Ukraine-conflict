## Introduction
On Feb 24, 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, and the U.S. government decided to aid Ukraine. However, there were different stances toward aid for Ukraine in U.S. discourse depending on political orientation. 
Traditionally, media engage in continuous discourse and reflect their positions. Subsequently, in this regard, we set up a following research question.

## Experiment
To find out RQ.1, we classified articles by media according to political orientation and analyzed them through LIWC. LIWC selected 5 features related to this issue and conducted a series of t-tests for each feature to verify whether there was a difference between progressive and conservative media. After that, the average values ​​were compared to find out what meaning was implied.
